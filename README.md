- Device registration and authentication
- iOS version-specific JIT enablement strategies
- Session management
- Anonymous usage statistics

### 3. iOS Integration Layer
Components that integrate the executor with iOS:
- Memory access utilities
- Jailbreak detection bypass
- UI controllers for overlay interface
- Game detection and integration

### 4. AI Features
Advanced AI systems that enhance the executor's capabilities:
- **Script Generation**: AI-powered script creation based on natural language descriptions
- **Script Debugging**: Automatic detection and fixing of script errors
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identification of game vulnerabilities and exploits
- **Self-Adapting Code**: Code that evolves to bypass detection mechanisms
- **Hybrid AI Processing**: Combination of on-device and cloud-based AI models
- **Local Models**: Offline operation with on-device AI models for privacy and performance
- **Script Assistant**: Interactive AI assistant for scripting help and guidance
- **Signature Adaptation**: Automatic adjustment to game security updates

### 5. Security Features
Comprehensive security measures to protect both the executor and user:
- **Anti-Tamper Protection**: Prevents modification of the executor's code
- **Anti-Debugging Measures**: Detects and prevents debugging attempts
- **VM Detection Avoidance**: Bypasses virtual machine detection mechanisms
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted communication with backend services
- **WebKit Exploitation**: Uses WebKit's JIT capabilities to bypass iOS restrictions
- **Dynamic Message Dispatching**: Obfuscated message passing between components
- **Method Swizzling Exploit**: Runtime modification of Objective-C methods
- **LoadString Support**: Enhanced loading of obfuscated scripts
- **Content Security Policy Bypass**: Circumvents WebKit security policies

## Technical Details

### Lua VM Implementation
The executor uses a custom implementation of the Luau VM with the following enhancements:

## Technical Details

### Lua VM Implementation
The executor uses a custom implementation of the Luau VM with the following enhancements:
- Support for Roblox-specific Lua extensions
- Optimized bytecode execution
- Custom memory management
- Integration with iOS memory systems

### JIT Compilation
The JIT compilation system works by:
1. Detecting the iOS version of the device (iOS 15, 16, or 17+)
2. Applying the appropriate JIT enablement strategy:
   - iOS 17: Memory permission toggle with W^X security policy compliance
   - iOS 16: CS_DEBUGGED flag setting with memory permission manipulation
   - iOS 15: Legacy approach with CS_DEBUGGED flag and memory toggling
3. Setting memory page permissions to allow executable memory (RWX)
4. Compiling Lua bytecode to native machine code at runtime
5. Communicating with the JIT Backend service for authentication and instructions
6. Implementing version-specific bypass techniques for each iOS version

### Anti-Detection Measures
The executor employs multiple sophisticated strategies to avoid detection:

#### Code Protection
- **Advanced Obfuscation**: Multi-layered code obfuscation techniques
- **Memory Signature Manipulation**: Alters memory signatures to avoid pattern detection
- **Hook Interception**: Intercepts and modifies function hooks used by anti-cheat systems
- **Dynamic Code Adaptation**: Automatically adapts code patterns based on detection attempts

#### iOS-Specific Bypasses
- **WebKit Exploitation**: Uses WebKit's JIT capabilities to execute code outside scanning range
- **Method Swizzling**: Runtime modification of Objective-C methods to bypass security checks
- **Dynamic Message Dispatching**: Obfuscated message passing between components
- **Jailbreak Detection Bypass**: Comprehensive countermeasures against jailbreak detection

#### Memory Protection
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Non-standard memory access patterns to avoid detection
- **W^X Policy Compliance**: Works within iOS Write XOR Execute memory protection
- **CS_DEBUGGED Flag Manipulation**: Safely sets and manages the CS_DEBUGGED flag
- **Memory Region Hiding**: Conceals critical memory regions from scanning

### AI Integration
The AI features are implemented through a sophisticated hybrid system:

#### Hybrid AI Architecture
- **Local On-Device Models**: Lightweight AI models that run directly on the device
- **Cloud-Based Services**: More powerful AI processing available when online
